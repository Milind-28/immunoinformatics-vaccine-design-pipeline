# Immunoinformatics-Based Multi-Epitope Vaccine Design Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end immunoinformatics pipeline
for designing conserved multi-epitope peptide vaccine candidates,
integrating sequence analysis, safety filtering, HLA Class I & II
prediction, cross-validation, and structural analysis.

## Pipeline Stages
1. Protein sequence retrieval
2. Peptide generation and mapping
3. Autoimmunity (host-homology) filtering
4. HLA Class I epitope prediction and validation
5. HLA Class II epitope prediction and validation
6. Multi-epitope vaccine construction
7. Structural docking and visualization

## Tools & Methods
- NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, DeepMHCII
- BLASTp (short-query optimization)
- Python, R, Excel (VBA)
- Docking and structure-based validation

## Notes
This repository reflects research-grade computational workflows
developed during an MSc Biotechnology thesis.
