# SFTSV Immunoinformatics Workflow


This repository contains a **publication‑safe skeleton implementation** of an immunoinformatics‑based multi‑epitope vaccine design workflow developed during an MSc Biotechnology thesis.


The repository documents **how the computational workflow is structured and executed**, while intentionally excluding unpublished results and licensed third‑party software.


## Workflow Summary
1. Protein sequence retrieval
2. Conserved region and peptide generation
3. Host‑homology (autoimmunity) filtering
4. HLA Class I epitope prediction and validation
5. HLA Class II epitope prediction and validation
6. Multi‑epitope vaccine construct design
7. Structural validation and visualization


A detailed workflow description is available in `docs/workflow_overview.md`.


## Data Availability
This repository contains **example data only**. All results from the associated manuscript are withheld until formal publication.


## Licensed Software Notice
NetMHCpan and NetMHCIIpan are licensed software and are **NOT included** in this repository. Users must obtain them independently from official sources and configure executable paths locally.


## Intended Use
This repository is intended for:
- Methodological transparency
- Portfolio and interview demonstration
- Reproducibility of computational logic


It is **not** intended as a clinical or diagnostic system.
